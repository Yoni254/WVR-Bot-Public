                            <p>4 things you can do and all are highly recommended:
                                <br><br>
                                1. Share and use in-game IDs to group up<br>
                                2. Ask around, talk with people here on discord<br>
                                3. Use voice chat here on discord too, even if alone in there shows you're ready to team up<br>
                                4. Keep an eye on the events and gatherings channels</p>

                            <p>Settlements are our way of realistically separating our vast amount of members into teams or “settlements” of 20-40 people. Each settlement contains a specific amount of slots for each <b>basic role</b> and is lead by both a <b>PvE leader (Governor) & PvP Leader (Major)</b>.  Each leader is in charge of leading and organizing events to help the settlement members remain taken care of happy and over all thriving. In addition each settlement is assigned 1-2 workshops which they consider “Their” territory or land to call there own for lore, social gatherings or General material farming!!!</p>

I’m 21 years of age, and currently reside in northern NJ, USA. My experience as a leader takes me from ARK, Call Of Duty, management IRL, and many other corners of the leadership  spectrum. I’m happy to introduce myself to old and new comers as the second admin and leader of the ENTIRE military branch to not get shit twisted 🍾. I pride myself as a New Yorker for my drive and determination. I’m very proud to call all of you my family and hope this helped y’all get an idea of who’s leading you all. Cheers y’all 🍻🍺👍</p>
